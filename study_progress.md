- **Status**: In Progress
- **Score**: 3/6 completed (3 correct)
- **Last Reviewed**: Current session

### Question Results

#### ✅ Question 1: How does a CNN differ from a fully connected network?
- **Status**: CORRECT (after guidance)
- **Key Points Covered**:
  - ✅ Local connectivity (receptive fields)
  - ✅ Parameter sharing (same filters slide across image)
  - ✅ Spatial preservation (maintains 2D structure)
- **Areas to Review**: None - solid understanding
- **Flashcard Ready**: Yes

#### ✅ Question 2: What roles do pooling and activation functions play?
- **Status**: CORRECT
- **Key Points Covered**:
  - ✅ Pooling: Reduces spatial dimensions (2×2 window)
  - ✅ Pooling benefits: Fewer parameters, lower computational cost, filters irrelevant details
  - ✅ Pooling: Provides translation invariance (recognizes features in different positions)
  - ✅ Activation functions: Introduce non-linearity (enables learning complex patterns)
- **Areas to Review**: None - excellent understanding
- **Flashcard Ready**: Yes

#### ✅ Question 3: Why are CNNs suitable for visual input in RL?
- **Status**: CORRECT (with guidance)
- **Key Points Covered**:
  - ✅ Spatial hierarchy: Builds complexity from edges → shapes → objects
  - ✅ Automatic feature extraction: Understands environment without manual engineering
  - ✅ Translation invariance: Recognizes features regardless of position (critical in dynamic RL environments)
- **Areas to Review**: Could benefit from mentioning parameter efficiency and scalability
- **Flashcard Ready**: Yes
